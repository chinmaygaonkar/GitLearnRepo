Books on java:
headfirst_java
headfirst design patterns
headfirst ootd
headfirst jsp and servlets
effective java
java 8 in action

weaker concepts:
Linked List
inner class(nested class)


primitive data types
byte
char
boolean
short
int 
long
float
double

implicit conversion
for small datatype to large.

explicit typecasting
int k = (int)5.6
only 5 will be in k
---------------------------
naming convention
interface should be _able like runnable first letter capital
class name should be noun first letter capital
method  should be verb first letter small
variable first letter small 
constant full capital
package everything small 

camelcasing when we use two words MyJava
second wrd first letter capital
for package and constant we use underscore

-----------------------
best practices
dont duplicate the code cuz if changes are made in one other is forgotten.


-----------------------------
constructor
constructor has same name as class name
even if you dont define it wil be there - it is called default constructor
it used to allocate memory to the object
it will never return anything
we can initialize values

different types of constructors
default constructor
parameterized constructor
